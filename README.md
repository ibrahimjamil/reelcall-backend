## Running Tests

$ npm run test
```

### Integration Tests

We haven't built an integration testing suite yet ðŸ˜±

## Running Locally

You must be locally running a MySql DB with a `reelcall` schema.

**Clone the repository and install the dependencies**

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/reelcall/reelcall-graph.git
$ cd reelcall-graph
$ npm install
```

**Setup Environment Variables**

```shell
$ cp example.env .env
```

Update any environment variables that aren't set or may have different values on your machine. Ask someone for help if you aren't sure what to do here.

**Run DB Migrations**

```shell
$ npx prisma migrate reset
```

**Run the Server**

```shell
$ npm run dev
```

Assuming you don't see any errors in the console, you should be good to go! ðŸŽŠðŸŽŠ

## Contributing

If you want to contribute, fetch the latest version of `main` and create your own feature branch off of that. When you're ready create a pull request into `main`, and ask someone for a code review.

If you want to create a new GraphQL resolver, you should use `npx plop resolvers` to autogenerate all the boilerplate code.
